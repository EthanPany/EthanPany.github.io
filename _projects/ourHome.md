**Our Home and What It Means to Us** is an interactive game that explores the concept of **home and belonging**, now enhanced with **AI integration**. The project delves into the different ways that **home can be experienced**, not just as a physical space but also as a feeling of **comfort, support, and identity**. The game encourages players to **reflect on their own experiences** of home through an engaging, story-driven experience, enriched with **philosophical AI dialogues**.

### AI Integration: Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Humanities
In an effort to fuse **artificial intelligence** with **interactive gaming**, the game now features an AI-powered **philosophical agent**. This agent uses a **language model (LLM)** to provide **real-time advice** and **reflective dialogue** based on the player's interactions. Players can engage in conversations with the AI, which acts as a **philosopher-like character**, offering insights and guidance on **family problems** and other personal conflicts. This addition aims to bridge the gap between **technology and humanities**, using AI as a tool to address **complex human issues**.

The integration was inspired by the desire to **make AI more meaningful** in the context of gaming, transforming the game from just a visual experience into an **interactive dialogue** that helps players explore deeper **philosophical questions** about **family, home,** and **personal growth**.

### Development Process
The project evolved through several stages:
- **Initial Concept**: The game began as a way to explore the concept of home through **interactive storytelling**, where players could connect with everyday objects that symbolize aspects of home.
- **AI Integration**: In **Dec. 2023 â€“ Jan. 2024**, a significant update introduced the **GPT-powered AI** agent into the game. The AI can generate **real-time poetry**, offer **philosophical insights**, and respond to player inputs, deepening the emotional and reflective aspects of the game.
- **Technology Used**: The integration was implemented using **Unity (3D game engine), C#**, and **ChatGPT's API**, showcasing how modern AI can be combined with gaming to **enhance player experiences**.

### Features
- **Exploration of Everyday Objects**: Players navigate a series of rooms, each containing objects that **represent different aspects of home**. These items trigger **memories and emotions**, creating a personal connection for the player.
- **AI-powered Philosophical Agent**: Players can converse with the AI character, which provides **real-time advice** on **family conflicts** or **life reflections**, acting as a virtual philosopher.
- **Narrative and Poetry Generation**: The AI can generate **custom poetry** and **reflective dialogues**, making each player's experience unique based on their interactions.
- **Atmospheric Sound Design**: The soundscape adds to the immersive environment, enhancing the game's emotional depth.
