It was developed as a response to the growing number of people struggling to maintain healthy eating habits, with many mistakenly believing that <strong>exercise alone</strong> is the most effective way to stay fit. Calglass combines <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>AI algorithms</strong> to recognize foods and calculate <strong>caloric content</strong>, providing users with <strong>actionable insights</strong> to improve their diets.</p> <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3> <p>The idea for Calglass originated from the observation that <strong>unhealthy eating habits</strong> contribute significantly to conditions like <strong>obesity</strong> and <strong>heart disease</strong>. The team noticed that existing dietary management solutions, such as <strong>mobile apps</strong>, often require extensive manual input and can be inaccurate. Inspired by this gap, Calglass aims to offer a <strong>more efficient, real-time solution</strong> by automatically analyzing food intake through wearable glasses.</p> <h3 id="development-journey">Development Journey</h3> <h4 id="early-stages">Early Stages</h4> <p>The project began with extensive <strong>research and brainstorming</strong>, aiming to find a practical way to integrate <strong>AI</strong> into dietary management. The team recognized that using a <strong>wearable device</strong> could provide the <strong>convenience and real-time analysis</strong> needed to help people make healthier choices effortlessly.</p> <h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3> <p>Calglass was built using a combination of hardware components:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/proj_calGlass/IMG3493-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/proj_calGlass/IMG3493-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/proj_calGlass/IMG3493-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_calGlass/IMG3493.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="3D Model of Calglass" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null;
