The project delves into the different ways that <strong>home can be experienced</strong>, not just as a physical space but also as a feeling of <strong>comfort, support, and identity</strong>. The game encourages players to <strong>reflect on their own experiences</strong> of home through an engaging, story-driven experience, enriched with <strong>philosophical AI dialogues</strong>.</p> <h3 id="ai-integration-exploring-the-intersection-of-technology-and-humanities">AI Integration: Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Humanities</h3> <p>In an effort to fuse <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> with <strong>interactive gaming</strong>, the game now features an AI-powered <strong>philosophical agent</strong>. This agent uses a <strong>language model (LLM)</strong> to provide <strong>real-time advice</strong> and <strong>reflective dialogue</strong> based on the player’s interactions. Players can engage in conversations with the AI, which acts as a <strong>philosopher-like character</strong>, offering insights and guidance on <strong>family problems</strong> and other personal conflicts. This addition aims to bridge the gap between <strong>technology and humanities</strong>, using AI as a tool to address <strong>complex human issues</strong>.</p> <p>The integration was inspired by the desire to <strong>make AI more meaningful</strong> in the context of gaming, transforming the game from just a visual experience into an <strong>interactive dialogue</strong> that helps players explore deeper <strong>philosophical questions</strong> about <strong>family, home,</strong> and <strong>personal growth</strong>.</p> <h3 id="development-process">Development Process</h3> <p>The project evolved through several stages:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Initial Concept</strong>: The game began as a way to explore the concept of home through <strong>interactive storytelling</strong>, where players could connect with everyday objects that symbolize aspects of home.</li> <li> <strong>AI Integration</strong>: In <strong>Dec. 2023 – Jan. 2024</strong>, a significant update introduced the <strong>GPT-powered AI</strong> agent into the game. The AI can generate <strong>real-time poetry</strong>, offer <strong>philosophical insights</strong>, and respond to player inputs, deepening the emotional and reflective aspects of the game.</li> <li> <strong>Technology Used</strong>: The integration was implemented using <strong>Unity (3D game engine), C#</strong>, and <strong>ChatGPT’s API</strong>, showcasing how modern AI can be combined with gaming to <strong>enhance player experiences</strong>.</li> </ul> <h3 id="features">Features</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Exploration of Everyday Objects</strong>: Players navigate a series of rooms, each containing objects that <strong>represent different aspects of home</strong>. These items trigger <strong>memories and emotions</strong>, creating a personal connection for the player.</li> <li> <strong>AI-powered Philosophical Agent</strong>: Players can converse with the AI character, which provides <strong>real-time advice</strong> on <strong>family conflicts</strong> or <strong>life reflections</strong>, acting as a virtual philosopher.</li> <li> <strong>Narrative and Poetry Generation</strong>: The AI can generate <strong>custom poetry</strong> and <strong>reflective dialogues</strong>, making each player’s experience unique based on their interactions.</li> <li> <strong>Atmospheric Sound Design</strong>: The soundscape adds to the immersive environment, enhancing the game’s emotional depth.</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-02-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-02-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-02-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-02.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="In-game Exploration" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-38-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-38-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-38-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-37-38.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Interactive Objects" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-44-18-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-44-18-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-44-18-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_home/Snipaste_2024-10-21_23-44-18.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Philosophical AI Agent" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="meaning-of-home">Meaning of Home</h3> <p>The project reflects on the notion that <strong>home is not defined solely by its physical boundaries</strong>.
